Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
