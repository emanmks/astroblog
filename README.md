# Astro Blog

A simple blog made using Astro. The blog is for learning purpose only, and the output of the astro blog tutorial.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
|   â””â”€â”€ components/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ *.astro # astro components
|   |   â””â”€â”€ *.jsx  # react components
|   |   â””â”€â”€ *.svelte # svelte components
|   |   â””â”€â”€ ...
|   â””â”€â”€ layouts/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ BaseLayout.astro
|   |   â””â”€â”€ MarkdownPostLayout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ posts/
|   |   |   â””â”€â”€ post-1.md
|   |   |   â””â”€â”€ ...
|   |   â””â”€â”€ tags/
|   |   |   â””â”€â”€ [tag].astro
|   |   |   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ about.astro
|   |   â””â”€â”€ blog.astro
|   |   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
|   |   â””â”€â”€ rss.xml.js
|   â””â”€â”€ scripts/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ menu.js
|   â””â”€â”€ styles/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ global.css
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
